        Choice of Career is a research essay I made earlier in the school year,
        the topic was a career of our choice so I chose to write about an
        occupation that I found interesting. The purpose of this essay was to do
        research on the career and determine if it was a job a person should
        pursue. I wrote this essay not only with just the research I did for it
        but also with personal feelings since the occupation is something I have
        a personal connection to. This essay shows off my more recent writing
        skills and how I’m able to write up text content.

        Online Friendships was an essay I wrote during my sophomore year of high
        school in my English 10 class. The topic of the essay was about online
        relationships and how safe it was to make friends with people online. I
        wrote my essay defending online friendships and stated ways a person
        could communicate with others online safely. The purpose I wanted my
        essay to have was to ease the paranoia and fear of parents with young
        children who actively use the internet. I believe I did an excellent job
        on my paper and thought it would be a great example of my writing work
        to display as it shows my writing skills.
