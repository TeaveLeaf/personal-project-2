          Coin Party is a game I worked on with a partner for our game project. We were instructed to base our website off of a
          board game but with a twist in how you played it, so my partner and I decided to create our game as a mix of the board
          game Monopoly and the video game Pummel Party. The rules for Monopoly were completely replaced with Pummel Party but the
          mechanics still stayed the same as Monopoly for the most part. The last change we made to the game rules was that the
          winner would be the player who collected the least amount of coins, hence the name Coin Party. We used Visual Studio
          Code (VSC), which is the software I usually use for my coding projects, and Netlify for our project. VSC was used for
          our coding while Netlify uploaded our website to the internet. Of course during our project there were a lot of problems
          and issues we ran into. Some problems we encountered that were easy to solve were our player sprites cloning themselves
          on the board, visibility, and getting the players to land in the right spots after rolling the dice. We resolved those
          problems very quickly but were met with issues that weren’t so easy to fix, especially with the JavaScript. Our card
          deck function wouldn’t work no matter how much we worked on it and ended up having to scrap it because of how little
          time we had left. The result is a completely functional game that even has one A.I. player but with the cards gone the
          game no longer has the entertainment factor. Even if it does not have the cards function and the visuals are not very
          nice, I am still extremely happy with this project. I learned a lot about JavaScript during this project and I am
          excited to use the knowledge I gained from this project for the next one.
