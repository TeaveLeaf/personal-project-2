        This is a logo I designed for a family member’s clothing brand. She
        asked me to come up with a variety of designs, and she would choose
        whichever one she liked most, so I dedicated a couple days to come up
        with concept designs for her logo before proceeding with any of them.
        The logo was meant to represent her clothing brand and make her store’s
        page look more professional. I chose to show this art piece because I
        wanted to show my ability to come up with and design logos for brands
        and other organizations. I think I did a good job on it, and she still
        continues to use the logo I made for her as the representative of her
        clothing brand today.

        This is a personal art piece I designed for an original chracter I made.
        I wanted to make it seem like a video game poster while showing off
        something that would represent my character's story. I chose to show off
        this art piece because it is my most recent work of art and shows off my
        current art skills. I put a lot of effort into this and it took me
        almost 7 hours to complete.

        This is a poster I made for the animation club at school. The activities
        office told us to create posters to hang around the school building so I
        designed this. It was meant to catch the eye of students who are
        interested in art or animation. I chose to show off this piece of art
        because I wanted to show off my skills in making posters.
