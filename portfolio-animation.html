            The Career Skills Challenge was a contest to display your skills that I participated in with a student from the
            Interactive Game Design lab. We ended up teaming together since they had signed up solo and needed a teammate. I wasn’t
            sure how it was going to turn out but we ended up working very well together. They worked on the storyboarding,
            sketching, and backgrounds while I did the animation and coloring. It was an incredibly stressful time; we spent every
            free second we had devoted to the animation, and were even working on it up to the deadline. The editing was a little
            messy but the animation still came out amazingly and I’m extremely proud of it. The movements are smooth and the colors
            all go together perfectly, it turned out even better than we’d expected. Unfortunately, because of the short time we
            had, there were multiple scenes we had to cut out of the animation that would’ve been nice to have, but if we wanted to
            get it done on time we had to remove them. Even so, it still turned out great and we ended up winning first place. I
            chose to display this piece because I put a lot of effort and time into it while pressured with a time limit. The
            finished product shows the result of all of that work and I want to put out my most recent work for others to see.
